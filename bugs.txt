- Python memory management isn't implemented properly.  There's a
  "registry" workaround in pyla.py which is essentially a memory leak.
  However, this doesn't work properly when the interpreter exits, so
  you might see some error messages.  At the root of this is an
  architecture problem that will be adressed at some point, but the
  bug doesn't really get in the way of practical use.
